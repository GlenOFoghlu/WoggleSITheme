# Scout IT! Wordpress Theme

## Summary:

The Scout IT! Wordpress theme is a theme developed for use on Scouting related websites (Groups, Districts or even Counties). This theme uses elements of the HTML5 Reset Wordpress theme which was used when the theme was first created, you could say the theme has been built on top of it.

### Warning:

It is highly recommended that this theme is only used by those comfortable with website technologies (XHTML, HTML5 and CSS). This theme wasn't intended to be released, therefore the code is very untidy (compared to other Wordpress themes) and may require alot of heavy coding to get it working how you want it on your Wordpress installation. Especially as the navigation menus (header and sidebar) and the meta data is hardcoded into the theme.

#### Credits:

Thanks to the people on the Escouts and Online Scout Manager forums for the positive comments and feedback received when I first unveiled this theme on my Scout Group website. It is those comments and feedback that has encouraged me to package the theme up properly and release it to those that want to use it.

The 'bodybg.jpg' background files used on the main template and error page were NOT developed by me. They were developed by PRODO Digital for the Cheshire Scouts website, they are only provided in this package as an example background, I highly recommend finding your own background to use as a background image (simply overwrite the bodybg.jpg and 404.jpg files found in _/img/). If you do use the example background images bundled with this package, I highly recommend you get permission, or at the very least credit the original source (PRODO Digital/Cheshire Scouts).

##### Theme Features:

1. jQuery and jQuery UI ready, pulls the js files from Google CDN so you don't have to!
2. Uses the same jQuery Content Slider that used to be used on Scouts.org.uk - script can be found/edited in page.php (script will only display on a page set as the homepage).
3. Has Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorers sub-templates (Basically changes the image/section menu above the sidebar on the right).
4. Meta tags ready for population (found in header.php).

##### Support and Liability:

Unfortunately I won't be offering any support for this theme, hence the suggestion that the theme only be used by people who are comfortable with website coding/technologies. On a similar note I won't accept any liability for damage or loss of data on your website and/or server(s). That said, I have taken all reasonable precautions to ensure this package contains no viruses or malware.
