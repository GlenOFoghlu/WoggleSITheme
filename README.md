# Woggle SI Wordpress Theme

## Summary:

The Woggle SI Wordpress theme is a theme developed for use on Scouting related websites. This theme is buit upon the HTML5 Rest Wordpress Theme.

----------

### Warning:

It is highly recommended that this theme is only used by those comfortable with website technologies (HTML5 and CSS and to a lesser extent PHP). This theme has not gon through the offical WP dev channels, therefore the code is very untidy (compared to other Wordpress themes), Its a working devlopment theme, meaning that the code is constantly evovling, hence my choce to place the source on GITHUB.com.

#### Credits:

The 'bodybg.jpg' background files used on the main template and error page were NOT developed by me. They were developed by PRODO Digital for the Cheshire Scouts website, they are only provided in this package as an example background, I highly recommend finding your own background to use as a background image (simply overwrite the bodybg.jpg and 404.jpg files found in _/img/). If you do use the example background images bundled with this package, I highly recommend you get permission, or at the very least credit the original source (PRODO Digital/Cheshire Scouts).

##### Theme Features:

1. jQuery and jQuery UI ready, pulls the js files from Google CDN so you don't have to!
2. Uses the same jQuery Content Slider that used to be used on Scouts.org.uk - script can be found/edited in page.php (script will only display on a page set as the homepage).
3. Has Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorers sub-templates (Basically changes the image/section menu above the sidebar on the right).
4. Meta tags ready for population (found in header.php).

##### Scouting Ireland Communications Team:

This theme was developed for use within Scouting Ireland(SI), and as such all references within the theme are for SI. PLease feel free to download and change the variable names yourself. I will supply support for Scouters within SI. 

##### Support and Liability:

Unfortunately I won't be offering any support for this theme, hence the suggestion that the theme only be used by people who are comfortable with website coding/technologies. Altought I am willing to give advice. On a similar note I won't accept any liability for damage or loss of data on your website and/or server(s).
