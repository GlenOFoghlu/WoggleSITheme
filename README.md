----------


> ### Warning:

>It is highly recommended that this theme is only used by those comfortable with website technologies (HTML5 and CSS and to a lesser extent PHP). This theme has not gon through the offical WP dev channels, therefore the code is very untidy (compared to other Wordpress themes), Its a working devlopment theme, meaning that the code is constantly evovling, hence my choce to place the source on GITHUB.com.

##### Theme Technical Features:

1. jQuery and jQuery UI ready, pulls the js files from Google CDN so you don't have to!
2. Uses the same jQuery Content Slider that used to be used on Scouts.org.uk - script can be found/edited in page.php (script will only display on a page set as the homepage).
3. Meta tags ready for population (found in header.php).

#### Theme Scouting Features:

1. Has Beavers, Cubs, Scouts Ventures, and Rovers sub-templates 
2. Logo defaults to SI logo if Group does not have a logo
3. Background is changable, to allow for indivialision of theme.

##### Scouting Ireland Communications Team:

This theme was developed for use within Scouting Ireland(SI), and as such all references within the theme are for SI.

#### Credits:

The 'bodybg.jpg' background files used on the main template and error page were NOT developed by me. They were developed by PRODO Digital for the Cheshire Scouts website, they are only provided in this package as an example background, I highly recommend finding your own background to use as a background image (simply overwrite the bodybg.jpg and 404.jpg files found in _/img/). If you do use the example background images bundled with this package, I highly recommend you get permission, or at the very least credit the original source (PRODO Digital/Cheshire Scouts).


##### Support and Liability:

Support will be provided to members of Scouting Ireland, Since this is a theme developed solely for the use within the organistion, I cannot support if this theme is modifyed in any way other then the way that it has been intended to be used.
